Car Sales Database - Coursework
This repository contains the code for a car sales database created as part of a coursework project. The database is designed to store information about car profiles, messages between users, car brands and models, car configurations, announcements, status, and car sales history.

The database schema consists of multiple tables, including profiles, messages, brand, model, complictation, announcement, status, and history_car. Each table serves a specific purpose and stores relevant data related to car sales.

In addition to the database schema, the repository also includes views and stored procedures. The views, such as car_announcement and have_history, provide convenient ways to retrieve specific data from the database. The stored procedures, like sp_announcement_high and sp_profiles_add, offer predefined functionalities for querying and modifying the database.

Throughout the coursework, various SQL statements were used to create the tables, insert sample data, define views, and implement stored procedures. The provided code snippets in this README file showcase some of the key components of the database.

This project demonstrates the implementation of a comprehensive car sales database, encompassing various aspects of car listings, user profiles, messaging, and historical data. The code and schema provided can serve as a foundation for further development or as a learning resource for understanding database design and management in the context of car sales.
